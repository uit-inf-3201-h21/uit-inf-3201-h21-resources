* Lee et al. Debunking the 100X GPU vs. CPU Myth: An Evaluation of Throughput Computing on CPU and GPU, ISCA 2010. [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1816038.1816021](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1816038.1816021)
* Thread pools/executors and futures. [https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html) (example also shown in foilset 15)
*  All lectures, lecture notes, precept notes and topics notes.
* All projects and exercises.


Some notes on mandatory readings: 

* The Lee paper from ISCA (“Debunking...”): you don't need to remember anything about the kernels. The main part here is lessons learned about optimizations for the different architectures, architecture differences and how they compared them. 
* CSP: Communicating Sequential Processes (Hoare 1978, p666-hoare.pdf in Resources/Articles). We’re after the concept and ideas; don’t worry about remembering the syntax exactly or remembering the examples. You may also want to read the IBM developerworks article ([https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-csp1/index.html](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-csp1/index.html)) if you find that easier to read (part 1-3). You should be able to translate between process network drawings and simple pseudo code programs (PyCSP from the foils is ok).
