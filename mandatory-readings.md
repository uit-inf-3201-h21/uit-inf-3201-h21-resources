==============

* Update 2021-10-21: Chapter 6 and the CSP is removed from mandatory readings (this year). See notes further down. 

Mandatory readings
----------------

* Peter Pacheco, An Introduction to Parallel Programming, 1st Edition.
  - Hardcover ISBN: 9780123742605
  - eBook ISBN: 9780080921440

* Cuda Programming Guide, chapters 1-4. [http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html)
* CUDA Best Practices Guide, chapters 5-9. [http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html)
* Lee et al. Debunking the 100X GPU vs. CPU Myth: An Evaluation of Throughput Computing on CPU and GPU, ISCA 2010. [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1816038.1816021](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1816038.1816021)
* Thread pools/executors and futures. [https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html) (example also shown in foilset 15)
* All lectures, lecture notes, precept notes and topics notes.
* All projects and exercises.


Some notes on mandatory readings:

* The Lee paper from ISCA (“Debunking...”): you don't need to remember anything about the kernels. The main part here is lessons learned about optimizations for the different architectures, architecture differences and how they compared them.
  

Removed from mandatory readings (for this year): 
-------------------------------
* Chapter 6 of the main book. 
* p666-hoare.pdf in Files/articles (in Canvas).  The alternative text has disappeared. We need to find an alternative text. 

Notes about CSP 
* CSP: Communicating Sequential Processes (Hoare 1978, p666-hoare.pdf in Resources/Articles). We’re after the concept and ideas; don’t worry about remembering the syntax exactly or remembering the examples. You may also want to read the IBM developerworks article ([https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-csp1/index.html](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-csp1/index.html)) if you find that easier to read (part 1-3). You should be able to translate between process network drawings and simple pseudo code programs (PyCSP from the foils is ok).
  - TODO: the JCSP link no longer works.
