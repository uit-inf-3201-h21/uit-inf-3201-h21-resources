# FAQ

Here you find answers to frequently asked questions for the course INF-3201, fall 2021. We will update the FAQ as we go along.

## If I don't pass an assignment, what happens?
If you don't pass on the first try, you can get a second chance if you really tried the first time. The deadline will then be relatively short. At the end of the semester, you may perhaps get a last chance to deliver, but you shouldn't rely on that. We need the approved lists two weeks before the exam, so we don't have that much time to go extra rounds with the students after the last assignment.

## Will there be re-sit examinations?
There is no re-sit. In some cases, there is another exam in the next semester, but that doesn't always happen.
